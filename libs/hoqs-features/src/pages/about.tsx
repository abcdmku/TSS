    <h1>About us</h1>
    <div>
      Paraflex is a type of cabinet design that uses a Higher Order
      Quarter-Wave resonator system. It was developed to provide a more
      efficient and powerful alternative to traditional bass reflex and folded
      horn designs. The Paraflex system is designed to deliver a powerful,
      deep, and accurate bass response with minimal distortion. It is also
      capable of delivering high SPL levels with minimal power input.
    </div>
    <h2>
      Who are the creators of the Paraflex type system?
    </h2>
    <div>
      The Paraflex concept is the brainchild of its founders: M. Morgan J., D.
      Morgan (Flex Tech Design), and J. Vansickle (Paragon Concepts).
    </div>
    <h2>
      Where does the name Paraflex come from?
    </h2>
    <div>
      The name Paraflex is a fusion of two words: "Para" from Paragon Concepts
      and "Flex" from Flex Tech Design.
    </div>
    <h2> What kind of system is a Paraflex?</h2>
    <div>
      The Paraflex system is comprised of two parallel Quarter Wave Resonators
      that merge into a single exit chamber, known as the mouth. It consists
      of a Low Tuned Resonator (LTR) and a High Tuned Resonator (HTR),
      resulting in an efficient high-output SPL cabinet. The combination of
      LTR and HTR creates a high-pressure zone in front of the HTR chamber,
      enhancing cone control of the driver. Paraflex cabinets are typically
      slightly larger than other designs due to the need to tune both
      resonators and align their phases. However, once tuned, they deliver
      powerful and efficient performance.
    </div>
    <h2>What is a Higher Order Quarter-Wave?</h2>
    <div>
      The term "Higher Order Quarter-Wave" describes a quarter-wave cabinet
      with multiple resonators.
    </div>
    <h2>Are there only Paraflex subwoofers?</h2>
    <div>
      No, Paraflex extends beyond subwoofers to include mid-bass (kick-bins)
      and mid-range (tops) cabinet designs, available in single, double, or
      even triple configurations, all built on the same design principles.

    <h1>Practical Information</h1>
    <h2> Are braces required?</h2>
    <div>
      Yes, good and sufficient bracing is necessary, especially for subwoofer
      designs. Failure to brace the cabinet can result in reduced efficiency
      and a raised F-3 due to mechanical losses. Bracing prevents panel
      flexing and resonances while strengthening the enclosure, which is
      crucial as Paraflex subwoofer enclosures experience significant
      pressures.
    </div>
    <h2>Are holes in braces required?</h2>
    <div>
      No, holes in non-blocking braces for Paraflex subwoofer designs are
      primarily for aesthetic purposes or weight reduction. The impact on
      losses over the bandwidth is minimal. Compensating for lost volume can
      be achieved by adding some inner height to the cabinet design. In mid
      and top designs, solid braces may have some effect since sound-wave
      lengths are shorter and may influence the sound.
    </div>
    <h2>
      What is damping, stuffing, and padding used for?
    </h2>
    <div>
      Damping or padding is used to reduce resonances and vibrations in
      cabinet panels, minimizing transmission or reflections. This is
      typically achieved with bitumen or felt-type layers that can be affixed
      to the inside of the cabinet. Filling, wadding, or stuffing involves
      adding fluffy polyfill to specific parts of the cabinet volume. For
      instance, in Paraflex subwoofers, polyfill is used in the LTR or HTR at
      specific locations to eliminate resonances at particular frequencies.
    </div>
    <h2>
      What does the Helmholtz resonator do in Paraflex designs?
    </h2>
    <div>
      Helmholtz resonators are primarily used in mid-top design cabinets to
      tune or dampen specific frequencies, ensuring the cabinet's response is
      as flat as possible.
    </div>
    <h2>
      Do I need to round the edges of the panels inside the subwoofer cabinet?
    </h2>
    <div>
      No, rounding the edges or making small alterations inside the subwoofer
      cabinet is unnecessary. Since lower frequencies have long waves (e.g.,
      100Hz = 3 meters), they won't be affected by small bumps or rounded
      edges.
